                        <h1>The Extraordinary history of Mario</h1>
                        <p>39 years ago, in 1981, a Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto created the soon-to-be momumental fictional character — Mario. Acting as the Nintendo's mascot, as well as being the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games and became one of the most recognized and loved game characters ever created.<br>

                            At first Mario was known as Jumpman in the Donkey Kong game, released in 1981. He was renamed Mario later in 1982.<br>
                            
                            In 1985, Super Mario Bros. video game, the successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros. and the first in the Super Mario series of platformers, was developed and published by Nintendo in Japan for the Family Computer (Famicom). It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).<br>
                            
                            In Super Mario Bros. Mario saves Princess Toadstool (later known as Princess Peach) of the Mushroom Kingdom from King Koopa (later known as Bowser). To save the princess, Mario must conquer the eight worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom by going to the castle in each in order to defeat a minion of King Koopa.</p>
